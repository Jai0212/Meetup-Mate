## Acknowledgments
I would like to thank Appetize.io thanks to which I was able to simulate my app.

Additionally, the pictures for the various profiles and posts were all publicly available on Google and thus were used from there.

I worked on this project alone and will not be actively working on this project anymore (I will be creating other related projects). However, I would love any suggestions/feedback/collaborative requests.
